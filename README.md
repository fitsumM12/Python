# PYTHON 
## Python Data structure
## 1. SET
->Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. <br>
->Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>
->A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.<br>
->Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.<br>
->Sets are written with curly brackets.<br>
## 2. Tuples
->Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>
->Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>
->A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.<br>
->Tuples are written with round brackets.<br>
## 3. list
->Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>
->Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>
->Lists are created using square brackets:<br>
## 4. Dictionary
->Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.<br>
->A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.<br>
->As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.<br>
->Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values<br>
